<p class='fw4 tl lh-copy mb2'>Please read these terms of service (as updated from time to time by Outbox, “these terms”) carefully. By accessing or using useoutbox.com (the “Outbox Website”), or downloading, installing, or using the Outbox Powered Application (the “Outbox App”), or downloading, installing, accessing or using any of the services available from Outbox on the Outbox Website or through the Outbox App (in these terms we refer to these services as the “Outbox Services”), you accept and agree to these terms, along with Outbox’s Privacy Policy and Outbox’s Acceptable Use Requirements (each as updated from time to time by Outbox). By doing any of those things you also represent to us that you are legally authorized (or, if you are an individual, legally competent and over the age of 18 years) to accept and agree to these terms.</p>
<p class='fw4 tl lh-copy mb2'>Please also read our Privacy Policy to learn how we collect and use information. When we refer to the “Outbox Platform” in these terms we mean the Outbox Website together with the Outbox App and Outbox’s software and other intellectual property used or contained in the Outbox Website or the Outbox App</p>
<p class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>
You agree to not use the Offerings to:
<ol>
<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'> Submitting Order Forms/Your Outbox Order(s)<br><br>
    To receive one of the Outbox Services you first need to complete and submit to Outbox, Inc. (“we” or “us” or “Outbox”) a subscription order for that Outbox Service on our standard Order Form on the Outbox Website (the “Order Form”) and Outbox will need to accept that submitted Order Form for it to become effective. Order Forms should be completed and submitted by you electronically on the Outbox Website and you will receive an electronic notification from Outbox whether the submitted Order Form has been accepted or rejected by Outbox. Although it is very rare for Outbox to reject an Order Form, Outbox reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion. You can always submit follow-on subscription orders for additional Outbox Services by completing and submitting another Order Form and those also will need to be accepted by Outbox to become effective. In these Terms, we call all these submitted and accepted Order Forms the “Outbox Order(s)”. To receive a Outbox Service you need to have a separate active subscription in place (a “Subscription”) for that Outbox Service.

</li>
<br>
<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Bookable Rooms and Users<br>
<br>The Outbox Order for a Outbox Service will state the total number of physical rooms that may be reserved or “booked” under that Outbox Service (“Bookable Rooms”). The Outbox Service covered by your Subscription may only be accessed and used by individuals that have been authenticated on the Outbox Website as one of your Users under your Subscriptions (your “Users”). However, Outbox does not limit the number of individuals who can be authenticated on the Outbox Website as your Users under your Subscriptions.</li>
<br>
<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'> Our Agreement<br>
<br>
These Terms, along with our Privacy Policy, our Acceptable Use Requirements and the Outbox Order(s), (we refer to all of these together as “Our Agreement”) create a binding contract between you and us, and Our Agreement sets out the terms and conditions between you and us and explains our relationship as you and your Users access and use the Outbox Platform and Outbox Services. Our Agreement describes the Outbox Services we will provide to you and your Users, what you must pay to us and when, how we will work together, and other aspects of our business and legal relationship. Our Agreement is an important legal document so some of the languages is necessarily “legalese” but we have tried to make it as readable as possible. By accessing or using the Outbox Platform or the Outbox Services, you agree to all of the terms of Our Agreement.
</li>
<br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Rights Granted to You and Your Users.<br><br>You and your Users have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, right to access and use the Outbox Platform solely to be able to access and use the Outbox Services covered by your active Subscriptions (“Your Subscription Services”), but all subject to the terms of Our Agreement. Access and use by you and your Users of the Outbox Platform and Your Subscription Services is subject to all the limitations and restrictions in Our Agreement, including for each Subscription the maximum number of Bookable Rooms covered by that Subscription as stated in the Outbox Order for that Subscription. If there is unauthorized access or use of the Outbox Platform or any Outbox Service by you or any of your Users, Outbox </li><br>

You agree that, without our express preapproval, you will not, and you won’t allow any of your Users to: (a) use or launch any automated system that sends more request messages to our servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional browser; (b) access or use the Outbox Platform or the Outbox Services in any manner that damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs the Outbox Platform or Outbox Services or interferes with our or any other customer’s or user’s access to or use of the Outbox Platform or Outbox Services; or (c) attempt to gain unauthorized access to or use of the Outbox Platform or the Outbox Services.

We may modify the Outbox Platform or Outbox Services from time to time, including by adding or deleting features and functions, in an effort to improve the experience of you and other customers and users; but we are not required to do so. If we believe any improvements or modifications will significantly and harmfully affect how you and your Users access and use the Outbox Platform or Your Subscription Services or how the Outbox Platform or Your Subscription Services perform, we will notify you in advance.
We are not responsible for the content of Non Outbox Services (as defined below) or for losses, liabilities, actual or pending claims, actions, damages, expenses, costs of defense and reasonable attorneys’ fees (“Claims”) arising from your or your Users access or use of content, information, web sites, software, services and other materials of third parties with which you or your Users may interact when you or your Users access or use the Outbox Platform or Outbox Services (collectively, “Non Outbox Services”).

    </li><br>
<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'> Additional Terms Applicable to the Outbox App.<br><br>
    Subject to your compliance with Our Agreement, we grant you and your Users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable license to download, install, and run a copy of the Outbox App on mobile devices. Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, you and your Users may not: (a) copy, modify, or create derivative works based on the Outbox App; (b) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, or rent the Outbox App to any third party; or (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Outbox App. Outbox reserves all rights to the Outbox App not expressly granted to you and your Users under these Terms.
    If you or one of your Users access or download the Outbox App from any app store or distribution platform (like the Apple Store, Google Play, or Amazon Appstore) (each, an “App Provider”), then you acknowledge and agree, on behalf of yourself and that User, that you and that User must comply with the applicable terms and conditions and other requirements of such App Provider and that:
    These Terms are between you and Outbox, and not with App Provider, and that, as between Outbox and the App Provider, Outbox is solely responsible for the Outbox App.
    You are responsible for (a) your and your Users installing the Outbox App on mobile devices that meet the hardware, software, Internet and cellular service requirements specified in the applicable Outbox Documentation and (b) obtaining Internet access for those mobile devices to enable the Outbox App to communicate with the Outbox Platform via the Internet.
    App Provider has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services for the Outbox App.
    App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you or your Users have or any claims of any third party relating to the Outbox App or your or your Users’ possession and use of the Outbox App, including by not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Outbox App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
    In the event of any third party claim that the Outbox App, or your or your User’s possession and use of the Outbox App, infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, the Outbox App Provider will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any intellectual property infringement claim.
    App Provider and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your and your Users’ license of the Outbox App, and when you accept these Terms, App Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your and your Users’ license of the Outbox App against you and your Users as a third party beneficiary of these Terms.

<br>
<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Your Content.<br><br>
    The Outbox Services allow you and your Users to upload, transmit and use certain required information and other content to and through your and their access and use of the Outbox Platform and Your Subscription Services (in Our Agreement we call all of this “Your Content”). You are responsible for the accuracy, quality, legality and the way you and your Users acquire Your Content. You understand that Outbox will use Your Content to provide Your Subscription Services to you. You have or will obtain all rights necessary to provide Your Content to Outbox and for Outbox’s use of Your Content as provided under Our Agreement.

</li>
<br>
<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Your Data; Data Security; Excluded Data.<br><br>
    a.	Excluded Data. You agree that neither you nor any of your Users, employees or agents will provide any of the following (in any format) to Outbox or upload any of the following (in any format) in using the Outbox Services or accessing the Outbox Platform: any personal health information; biometric information; social security numbers; government identification numbers; credit report information, debit or credit or payment card information; or (other than your payment information provided in a Outbox Order) bank or other financial account information or other financial or credit data (collectively, “Excluded Data”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Our Agreement, except to the extent required by applicable law that cannot be waived, we won’t have any obligation or liability under Our Agreement or otherwise with respect to Excluded Data.
    b.	Your Data; License. As between you and your Users, on the one hand, and Outbox, on the other hand, you are the sole owner of all information or data relating to you or your Users or your business that is communicated to or collected by Outbox or the Outbox Platform under Our Agreement (in these terms we call all of this "Your Data" but the Term “Your Data” expressly excludes any Excluded Data and Contributions (as defined below)), and our Agreement does not provide Outbox with title or ownership of Your Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you grant to Outbox a perpetual, royalty free license to copy, use, distribute, display and disclose Your Data, Your Content and Excluded Data prior to and after the End Date: (i) to provide Your Subscription Services to you and your Users and otherwise perform Outbox’s obligations under Our Agreement; (ii) to monitor for security and compliance purposes access and use by you and your Users of the Outbox Platform and Your Subscription Services; (iii) to perform statistical and other analysis, including to improve the Outbox Platform and the Outbox Services, but in doing those analyses we won’t publicly disclose any of Your Data or Your Content except in an aggregated form that would not reasonably be expected to permit a third party to identify the disclosed information as associated with you or any of your Users; and (iv) to enforce the terms of Our Agreement. The license granted in this Section is sublicensable and assignable by Outbox to any of its affiliates, co-marketers and co-developers.
    c.	Data Security. Without limiting the terms of our Privacy Policy, you understand that we do not guarantee that your access or use of the Outbox Platform or the Outbox Services or that Your Content, Your Data, Excluded Data or your Confidential Information will be private or secure. We are not responsible or liable to you for any lack of privacy or security that you may experience. Information collected by your internet or mobile service provider and other third parties is used, stored, transferred and disclosed pursuant to your internet or mobile service provider’s or the third party’s terms, policies and practices. We encourage you to carefully consider disclosure of any information that might be accessible to others. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the Outbox Platform and Outbox Services.
    d.	What Happens to Your Data After the End Date. Outbox will keep all Your Data for a period of 90 days after the End Date (as defined below), and, if you request it of Outbox in writing during that 90 days, Outbox will transfer to you a copy of Your Data that has been kept by Outbox. Outbox will have no obligation to keep any of Your Data after the end of that 90 days (though it may keep a copy solely for purposes of exercising its license in Section 8(b)).
    
</li>

<br>
<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Confidentiality.<br><br>a.	Confidential Information.

    </li><br>


<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Fees<br><br>
    a.	Amount of Subscription Fees. The Outbox Order for a Subscription states the amount of the subscription fees and any other fees that must be paid by you to Outbox for that Subscription and Your Subscription Service provided as part of that Subscription (the “Subscription Fee”) but Outbox reserves the right to change the amount of the Subscription Fee that is payable for a renewal term of a Subscription so long as you get notice of that change in Subscription Fee at least 30 days before the start of the next renewal term for that Subscription. Except as expressly provided in the Outbox Order for a Subscription, renewal of promotional or one-time priced Subscriptions will be at Outbox’s applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal.
    b.	When Subscription Fees Are Due. You are required to pay the applicable Subscription Fee for a Subscription in advance on or before the first day of the term of that Subscription. You are also required to pay the applicable Subscription Fee for each renewal term of a Subscription in advance on or before the first day of the renewal term.
    c.	Methods of Payment. You will pay the Subscription Fees due from you for a Subscription by using the payment method specified in the Outbox Order for that Subscription.
    d.	Taxes are Not Included. All payments to Outbox under Our Agreement are net of any applicable sales, use and other taxes, and you are required to pay directly to the applicable tax authority (or reimburse Outbox) any taxes due in connection with Our Agreement, excluding only taxes on Outbox’s income. If you or your Users are located in the European Union, all fees are exclusive of any VAT and you represent that you are registered for VAT purposes in your member state. If you are subject to GST, all fees are exclusive of GST. If you are required to deduct or withhold any tax, you must pay the amount deducted or withheld as required by law and pay us an additional amount so that we receive payment in full as if there were no deduction or withholding.
    e.	Overdue Amounts. Outbox reserves the right to charge and collect an overdue payment fee on any unpaid, past-due Subscription Fees or other amount due to it under Our Agreement equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, calculated from the date such overdue payment was first due until it is paid in full. Payments are applied, at Outbox’s discretion, first to payment of the overdue payment fee and then to payment of the overdue amount.
    f.	No Cash Refunds. Outbox is never required to provide you a cash refund or credit of any Subscription Fees or other amounts paid by you, except as expressly required by Section 14. If you and Outbox agree to downgrade the level of Outbox Services covered by a Subscription, Outbox may decide, in its complete discretion, to allow you to pay a lower, pro-rated amount at renewal, but you won’t be entitled to a cash refund at any time, except as expressly required by Section 14.

    NOTHING IN OUR AGREEMENT EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR MATTERS FOR WHICH LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT LIMITS EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR MATTERS FOR WHICH LIABILITY CANNOT BE SO LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
    
</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Infringement.<br><br>
    If Your Subscription Service or the Outbox Platform becomes or, in our opinion, may become the subject of any claim, suit or proceeding for infringement of any United States or European Union patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property right under United States or European Union law, Outbox will, at its option and expense, either (i) obtain for you any additional right required under United States or European Union law for you to access and use the Outbox Platform and Your Subscription Service, (ii) replace Your Subscription Service with a non-infringing Outbox Service, (iii) modify the Outbox Platform or Your Subscription Service so that it does not infringe, or (iv) terminate the Subscription for Your Subscription Service, and refund the aggregate Subscription Fees paid by you to Outbox for that Subscription during the period of actual infringement. Outbox will not be liable for any infringement arising from: the combination of the Outbox Platform or a Outbox Service with other products or services; from the access or use of the Outbox Platform or a Outbox Service in practicing a process; or resulting from Your Content, Your Data or Excluded Data. Outbox’s total liability under Our Agreement with respect to an actual or alleged infringing Outbox Service, Outbox App or the Outbox Website will not under any circumstances exceed the aggregate Fees that you paid to Outbox for use of that Outbox Service, the Outbox App or the Outbox Website during the period of actual infringement by that Outbox Service, the Outbox App or the Outbox Website.
    This Section 14 constitutes Outbox’s only obligation and liability, and your exclusive remedy, for actual or alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties by any of the Outbox Platform or the Outbox Services.
    

</li><br>


<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Term and Termination; What Happens After the End Date.<br><br>
    a.	Term of Our Agreement. Our Agreement starts and is first effective on the date that Outbox accepts the first of your Outbox Order(s) and Our Agreement stays in effect until, and terminates, on the date that all Subscriptions have expired or terminated (whatever the reason for such expiration or termination, the “End Date”).
    b.	Term of Subscriptions. The term of each Subscription is month to month unless the Outbox Order for a Subscription says the term for that Subscription is different (in which case the term for that Subscription will be the term described in the Outbox Order for that Subscription). Unless the Outbox Order for a Subscription expressly prohibits automatic renewal (in which case that Subscription will not automatically renew), each Subscription will automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring term for that Subscription or one year (whichever is shorter), unless either you or Outbox gives the other written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the end of the relevant term for that Subscription.
    c.	Early Termination for Failure to Perform. Each of you and Outbox has the right (by giving written notice of termination) to terminate the Subscriptions (or any one or more of them) before the end of the scheduled terms of the Subscriptions if the other party fails to perform any of its obligations under Our Agreement. In the case of a failure to perform an obligation that relates to the intellectual property or confidential information of the other party, no notice or opportunity to cure is required before the early termination notice may be effective. In all other cases, prior written notice and 30 days (but only 5 business days in the case of a payment default) opportunity to cure is required before the early termination notice may be effective. If all the Subscriptions are terminated by you or Outbox under this Section, then the End Date occurs.
    d.	Suspension of Outbox Services for Failure to Pay. If you don’t make a payment to Outbox in full when due under Our Agreement Outbox has the right to suspend your and your Users’ rights to access and use the Outbox Platform or any or all of Your Subscription Services until all amounts due to Outbox under Our Agreement have been paid in full by you.
    e.	What Happens on The End Date. On the End Date, you and your Users must immediately stop accessing and using the Outbox Platform and the Outbox Services. All rights granted to you and your Users to access and use the Outbox Platform and the Outbox Services will end automatically and immediately on the End Date.
    f.	Surviving Provisions. Section 3 and Sections 8 through 30 (but as to Section 11(a) only Outbox’s continued right to be paid amounts due and owing to Outbox prior to the End Date and overdue payment fees accruing prior to or after the End Date) will survive the End Date and continue to be effective after the End Date.

</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Irreparable Damage; Injunctive Relief.<br><br> 
    Each of you and Outbox acknowledges that a violation of certain provisions of Our Agreement will result in substantial and irreparable damage to Outbox for which Outbox will not have an adequate remedy at law and for which money damages would not be a sufficient remedy, and you agree that, in addition to all other remedies, in the event of any breach or alleged or threatened breach by you or your Users of any of the provisions of Our Agreement, Outbox will be entitled 
    to equitable relief by any court of competent jurisdiction, including injunction and specific performance, in each case without being required to prove irreparable harm or damages, post a bond or otherwise provide security. The rights provided under this Section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Outbox at law or in equity.
</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Notices.<br><br> 

    Notices to Outbox must be sent by you to: or legal@useoutbox.com or to another physical or email address that Outbox tells you (in a notice) is its new notice address.

Notices are effective when actually delivered on a business day at the applicable physical address or when delivered on a business day by email to the applicable email address (or will be effect on the next business day when delivered by email to the applicable email address on a day other than a business day)
</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Assignment.<br><br> 
    Our Agreement is binding upon both you and Outbox and your and Outbox’s successors and permitted assigns. Outbox may assign any of its rights and obligations under Our Agreement to an affiliate or lender of Outbox or to someone that acquires all or any substantial part of Outbox’s business (by asset acquisition, merger or otherwise). Outbox may also assign or sublicense the license granted to it under Section 8(b) as permitted in Section 8(b). You may assign your rights and obligations under Our Agreement only with Outbox’s written consent, which Outbox won’t deny unreasonably.


</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>We Don’t Pay Kickbacks.<br><br> 
    You agree that you have not received or been offered any bribe or illegal or improper kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any of Outbox’s 
    employees or agents in connection with Our Agreement and the Subscriptions, but this doesn’t prevent us or our Distributors from offering or providing reasonable entertainment or gifts in the ordinary course of business unless that is prohibited by applicable law. If you learn of any prohibited offer or payment, please let us know as soon as possible. Please notify Our Legal Department at legal@useoutbox.com
</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Stuff Happens – Otherwise Called Force Majeure.<br><br> 
    Neither party will be responsible for failure or delay of performance (other than a payment obligation) if that failure or delay is caused by events beyond that party’s reasonable control, including, but not limited to, fire; storm; flood; earthquake; explosion; war; act of terrorism; strike or labor disruption; internet, telecommunication or utility outages; rebellion; insurrection; quarantine; boycott; embargo; shortage or unavailability of supplies or qualified personnel; riot; governmental law, regulation or edict; or scheduled or emergency inspection, maintenance, repair, or replacement of equipment, software or structure. But the party whose performance is blocked should make reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.


</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>	Amendment; Waiver of Our Agreement.<br><br> 
    a.	Periodic Updates and Modifications by Outbox. We reserve the right to update and modify these Terms, our Privacy Policy or our Acceptable Use Requirements at any time or from time to time. We encourage you to review these Terms, our Privacy Policy and our Acceptable Use Requirements periodically. Updates and modifications to these Terms, our Privacy Policy and our Acceptable Use Requirements become effective immediately upon your first access to or use of the Outbox Services after the “Last Revised” date at the top of this page (or the first page of our Privacy Policy or our Acceptable Use Requirements, as the case may be) and your or your Users’ continued access or use of the Outbox Platform or Your Subscription Services after the update or modification become effective is deemed your acceptance of the updated or modified Terms, Privacy Policy or Acceptable Use Requirements, as the case may be.
    b.	Delay in Effect of Update or Modification. But if you want to object to an update or modification to these Terms, our Privacy Policy or our Acceptable Use Requirements, you need to notify us in writing within 30 days after you first receive notice of the update or modification. If you give us this objection notice in time, your Subscription will continue to be governed by these Terms, our Privacy Policy or our Acceptable Use Requirements, as the case may be, but without the objected to update or modification, until the next renewal of the Subscription. After the next renewal, these Terms, our Privacy Policy and our Acceptable Use Requirements with all prior updates and modifications will govern the Subscription.
    c.	Amendment. Except for updates and modifications by Outbox described in clauses (a) and (b) above, no part of Our Agreement can be changed, amended or modified except by written agreement of you and Outbox expressly stating it is an amendment to Our Agreement.
    d.	Waiver. If Outbox or you (or any of your Users) fails to perform an obligation under Our Agreement, that failure can only be waived (so that it doesn’t matter) if the other party waives it in writing and a waiver will only apply to that specific failure. In other words, if another obligation is breached or if the same obligation is breached again, another written waiver is needed. The fact that the other party doesn’t object to a failure or demand that it be fixed or enforce its rights resulting from that failure does not mean that there is a valid waiver or that that party can’t object, demand it be fixed or enforce its rights for that or any other failure.
    

</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Severability.<br><br>
    We think all of the parts of Our Agreement are permitted under all the laws that apply to Our Agreement, but there are a lot of different laws that apply and sometimes laws change or the interpretation of laws change. If any section of Our Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any of the laws that apply  
    to Our Agreement, then you and Outbox agree that section of Our Agreement will be reformed automatically (in other words fixed) so that it is valid, legal and enforceable under all the applicable laws consistent with what you and Outbox originally intended that section to mean. In any case, the rest of Our Agreement stays in effect and isn’t affected by that invalid, illegal or unenforceable or reformed section.


</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Contract for Services.<br><br>
    Our Agreement is a contract for the provision of services and not a contract for the sale of goods. The provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, or any substantially similar legislation shall not apply to Our Agreement. You and Outbox agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the interpretation or construction of these terms or any other part of Our Agreement.



</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>	Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence.<br><br>
    These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, our Acceptable Use Requirements and the Outbox Order(s), contain the entire understanding of Outbox and you about the matters in these Terms and those other documents. You and Outbox agree that there are no oral or written promises, warranties, commitments or other undertakings or understandings between Robbin and you other than those written terms expressly included in these Terms, our Privacy Policy, our Acceptable Use Requirements and the Outbox Order(s). Outbox has not agreed to (and expressly rejects) any of your documentation or order forms (other than on our standard Order Forms), whether standard or preprinted terms or otherwise, even if you sent them with the Outbox Order(s) or referred to them in the Outbox Order(s) or elsewhere. The headings and captions contained in Our Agreement are for convenience only and don’t affect the interpretation or meaning of Our Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence shall be (i) the Order Forms, with a later Order Form controlling over the prior Order Forms; (ii) these Terms, (iii) our Terms of Acceptable Use, and (iv) our Privacy Policy.



</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Export Laws.<br><br>
    You agree that you will not export or re-export the Outbox Services and/or other information or materials provided by Outbox to any country that requires any export license or government approval without first getting that license or approval. You agree to comply with all applicable United States export laws and regulations, and are responsible for these laws and regulations at your own expense. You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.



</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Governing Law.<br><br>
    Our Agreement is governed by the internal laws of the Nigeria, and is binding upon the parties hereto in the Nigeria and worldwide.


</li><br>

<li class='fw4 tl lh-copy'>Binding Arbitration.<br><br>
   Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to Our Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of any provision of Our Agreement, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Lagos, Nigeria before one arbitrator. Either Outbox or you may commence the arbitration process called for in this Section by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules or pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, each as in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration. Each party will cooperate with JAMS and with the other party in selecting an arbitrator from JAMS’s panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings. Each of you and Outbox agrees that it will participate in the arbitration in good faith. The costs of the proceedings (including attorneys' fees and costs on a full indemnity basis or otherwise) shall be borne in the manner determined by the arbitrator. The provisions of this Section may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any procedural matter not covered by the relevant JAMS rules, the procedural law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall govern. The parties acknowledge and agree that their obligations under this arbitration provision survive and will continue to bind them after the End Date. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This Section won’t preclude either party from seeking equitable relief or provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the arbitration award, including the hearings and filings, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
